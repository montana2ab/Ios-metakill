This guide helps you quickly verify the PhotoKit integration works on iPhone or simulator.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS Simulator or physical device running iOS 15.0+
- For device testing: Apple Developer account with signing certificate

## Quick Start (Simulator)

### 1. Open and Build

```bash

cd path/to/Ios-metakill

# Open Xcode project
open MetadataKill.xcodeproj

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select any iPhone simulator (iPhone 15 recommended)
# 2. Press Cmd+B to build
# 3. Wait for build to complete
```

### 2. Add Test Photos to Simulator

Before running the app, add some photos to the simulator:

**Option A: Drag & Drop**
1. Run the simulator (Cmd+R)
2. Open Safari on simulator
3. Search for "test images" or use a photo website
4. Long-press on images and save to Photos

**Option B: Use Sample Photos**
1. Run the simulator
2. Open Photos app
3. It should have some default sample photos

### 3. Test Photo Selection

   - **Success**: ‚úÖ File picker works!

5. **Test Batch Processing**:
   - Go back to home
   - Tap "Batch Processing"
   - Tap "Select from Photos"
   - **Expected**: PHPicker allows selecting both images and videos
   - Select mixed media
   - **Expected**: All items appear in list
   - **Success**: ‚úÖ Mixed media selection works!

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

- App builds without compilation errors
- App launches without crashes
- Tapping "Select from Photos" shows PHPicker interface
- Tapping "Select from Files" shows Files browser
- Selected items appear in the view's list
- Each item shows name and file size
- No error messages in Xcode console

### ‚ùå Potential Issues

If something doesn't work, check:

1. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure iOS deployment target is 15.0+
   - Check Platform module is properly linked
   - Verify Swift version is 5.9+

2. **Picker Doesn't Appear**:
   - Check Info.plist has NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
   - Look for permission errors in console
   - Try resetting simulator: Device ‚Üí Erase All Content and Settings

3. **Files Not Loading**:
   - Check console for file copy errors
   - Verify temp directory is accessible
   - Check file permissions

## Testing on Physical Device

### 1. Configure Signing

```
In Xcode:
1. Select MetadataKill target
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
3. Check "Automatically manage signing"
4. Select your Team
5. Xcode will create a provisioning profile
```

### 2. Connect Device

```
1. Connect iPhone/iPad via USB
2. Trust computer on device if prompted
3. Select device in Xcode's device menu
4. Press Cmd+R to build and install
```

### 3. Grant Permissions

On first launch:
1. App will request Photo Library access
2. **Expected**: Permission dialog with your usage description
3. Tap "Allow Access to All Photos" or "Select Photos..."
4. **Success**: ‚úÖ Permission granted!

### 4. Test with Real Photos

1. Take a photo with Location Services enabled
2. Open MetadataKill
3. Select the photo
4. Clean it
5. Check if GPS data was removed (use a metadata viewer)

- Ensure `import Platform` is at top of file
- Check Platform module is included in target
- Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K) and rebuild

### Issue: "Photos app shows no photos"
**Solution**:
- Add photos to simulator first
- Or use device with real photos
- Check Photos app has content before testing

### Issue: Permission denied
**Solution**:
- Check Info.plist has permission keys
- Reset permissions: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Photos ‚Üí MetadataKill ‚Üí Toggle off/on
- Or reset simulator entirely

### Issue: App crashes on picker dismiss
**Solution**:
- Check Xcode console for error details
- Verify coordinator is properly retained
- Check for memory issues in Instruments

## Success!

If all tests pass:
- ‚úÖ PhotoKit integration is working
- ‚úÖ File pickers are working
- ‚úÖ App is ready for metadata cleaning
- ‚úÖ Implementation is complete!

## Next Steps After Verification

Once PhotoKit integration is confirmed working:

1. **Test Metadata Cleaning**:
   - Select photos with GPS data
   - Clean them
   - Verify metadata is removed

2. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Very large images (>20MB)
   - Many images at once (>50)
   - Different formats (JPEG, HEIC, PNG)
   - Videos with various codecs

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure cleaning time
   - Check memory usage
   - Test with low battery mode
   - Test with airplane mode (for iCloud)

4. **UI Polish**:
   - Check all text is localized
   - Verify dark mode support
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Check accessibility features

## Report Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console**: Look for errors in Xcode console
2. **Take Screenshots**: Capture any error messages
3. **Note Steps**: Document what you did before the issue
4. **Device Info**: Note iOS version, device model, Xcode version
5. **Create Issue**: File a bug report with all above info
