# Pull Request Summary: Fix Automatic Deletion of Photos/Videos

## Issue
"La suppression automatique des photos et vidéos après traitement et activation dans les préférences et validation ne fonctionne pas"
(Automatic deletion of photos and videos after processing and activation in preferences and validation doesn't work)

## Root Cause Analysis
The automatic deletion feature was not working for media selected from the Photos library because:

1. **PHPickerViewController behavior**: When users select photos/videos from the Photos library, PHPickerViewController provides temporary copies of the files, not direct access to the PHAsset objects.

2. **Missing PHAsset tracking**: The `MediaItem` model only stored the temporary file URL (`sourceURL`), not the PHAsset identifier needed to delete the original from the Photos library.

3. **Incomplete deletion logic**: `LocalStorageRepository.deleteOriginal()` could only delete files from writable file system locations. It had no way to delete assets from the Photos library because the PHAsset identifier was not available.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced MediaItem Model
Added a new optional field to track the Photos library asset:
```swift
public var photoAssetIdentifier: String? // PHAsset localIdentifier for Photos library items
```

### 2. Updated Photo/Video Pickers
Modified all three pickers to capture and store the asset identifier:
- `PhotoLibraryPicker.swift` - for images only
- `VideoLibraryPicker.swift` - for videos only  
- `MediaLibraryPicker.swift` - for both images and videos

Each now captures `result.assetIdentifier` from `PHPickerResult` and passes it to the `MediaItem` constructor.

### 3. Enhanced Deletion Logic
Updated `LocalStorageRepository.deleteOriginal()` to handle both scenarios:
- **Photos library items** (with `photoAssetIdentifier`): Uses `PhotoDeletionService` to delete from Photos
- **File system items** (without `photoAssetIdentifier`): Deletes from file system (existing behavior)

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
Added unit tests for:
- MediaItem creation with photoAssetIdentifier
- MediaItem creation without photoAssetIdentifier  
- JSON encoding/decoding of MediaItem with photoAssetIdentifier

**Total**: 7 files changed, 229 insertions(+), 20 deletions(-)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**:
- `photoAssetIdentifier` is optional with default value `nil`
- Existing code continues to work without modifications
- Document picker imports continue to work (will have `nil` for photoAssetIdentifier)
- Existing serialized MediaItem objects will decode successfully

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing on Device

1. **Enable automatic deletion**:
   - Open Settings
   - Enable "Delete original file after cleaning"
   - Confirm the warning dialog

2. **Test Photos library deletion**:
   - Select a photo from Photos library
   - Process it to remove metadata
   - Verify original is deleted from Photos library
   - Verify cleaned version is saved (if that setting is enabled)

3. **Test document picker** (should continue to work as before):
   - Import a photo from Files app
   - Process it
   - Verify file system deletion works

4. **Test with auto-delete disabled**:
   - Disable "Delete original file after cleaning"
   - Process a photo from Photos library
   - Verify original remains in Photos library

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
swift test --filter DomainTests
```

Expected: All tests pass, including the 3 new tests for photoAssetIdentifier.

## Code Review

✅ Code review completed - no issues found

## Additional Documentation

See `DELETION_FIX_EXPLANATION.md` for:
- Detailed flow diagrams
- Code snippets
- Testing scenarios
- Architecture explanation

## Benefits

1. **Fixes the reported bug**: Automatic deletion now works for Photos library items
2. **Clean implementation**: Leverages existing `PhotoDeletionService`
3. **Proper permissions**: PhotoDeletionService handles Photos permission requests
4. **Error handling**: Properly propagates deletion errors
5. **Maintainable**: Well-documented with tests
6. **Backward compatible**: No breaking changes

## Risks

⚠️ **Low Risk**:
- Changes are minimal and surgical
- All changes are backward compatible
- Extensive error handling in place
- PhotoDeletionService already tested and in use

## Deployment Notes

- No migration needed
- No changes to app settings or UI
- Existing functionality preserved
- Works immediately after deployment
