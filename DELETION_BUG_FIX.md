# Photo/Video Deletion Bug Fix

## Problem Statement (French)
> "le bouton de suppressions des photo ou video d origine et bien la cliquabke il demande la cofirmtion mais ne supprilme pas la photo dorgine dans la pellivule elle sont toujours la apres"

**Translation:** The delete button for original photos or videos is clickable and asks for confirmation, but doesn't delete the original photo from the camera roll - they are still there afterwards.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `PhotoDeletionService.swift` where the deletion logic had a critical flaw:

### Before Fix
```swift
let assets = PHAsset.fetchAssets(withLocalIdentifiers: [localIdentifier], options: nil)
PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(assets)
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    // ...
})
```

**Problem:** If `fetchAssets` returns 0 assets (invalid identifier or asset already deleted), `performChanges` would still succeed without actually deleting anything. The user would see no error, but the photo would remain in the library.

### After Fix
```swift
let assets = PHAsset.fetchAssets(withLocalIdentifiers: [localIdentifier], options: nil)

// Verify that we found the asset before attempting deletion
guard assets.count > 0 else {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        let err = NSError(domain: "PhotoDeletionService",
                          code: -2,
                          userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Asset not found with identifier: \(localIdentifier)"])
        completion(.failure(err))
    }
    return
}

PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({
    PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets(assets)
}, completionHandler: { success, error in
    // ...
})
```

**Solution:** Now we verify that at least one asset was found before attempting deletion. If no asset is found, we return an error immediately.

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Success Feedback
Previously, after clicking "Delete" in the confirmation dialog, nothing happened visually to indicate success or failure. Users were left wondering if the deletion worked.

**Added:**
- Success alert dialog showing number of files deleted
- Only shows when all deletions succeed (if any fail, error alert shows instead)

### 2. Localization
Added new localization strings in both English and French:

**English:**
```
"results.delete_success_title" = "Deletion Complete"
"results.delete_success_message" = "Successfully deleted %d original file(s)."
```

**French:**
```
"results.delete_success_title" = "Suppression Terminée"
"results.delete_success_message" = "%d fichier(s) d'origine supprimé(s) avec succès."
```

### 3. Better Error Tracking
Modified both `ImageCleanerViewModel` and `VideoCleanerViewModel` to:
- Track failed deletions separately
- Only show success if all deletions complete without errors
- Show error alert immediately if any deletion fails

## Files Modified

1. **Sources/Data/Storage/PhotoDeletionService.swift**
   - Added asset count validation before deletion
   - Returns error if asset not found

2. **Sources/App/Views/ImageCleanerView.swift**
   - Added `showingDeleteSuccess` published property
   - Updated `confirmDeleteOriginalFiles()` to track failures
   - Added success alert dialog
   - Shows success only when all deletions succeed

3. **Sources/App/Views/VideoCleanerView.swift**
   - Same changes as ImageCleanerView
   - Maintains consistency across image and video cleaners

4. **Localization Files** (4 files)
   - Sources/App/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings
   - Sources/App/Resources/fr.lproj/Localizable.strings
   - MetadataKill/en.lproj/Localizable.strings
   - MetadataKill/fr.lproj/Localizable.strings
   - Added success title and message strings

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Deletion
1. Select photos from Photos library
2. Process them successfully
3. Click "Delete Original Files" button
4. Confirm deletion
5. **Expected:** Success alert shows "Successfully deleted X original file(s)."
6. **Expected:** Original photos are removed from Photos library

### Scenario 2: Asset Not Found
1. Select photos from Photos library
2. Process them successfully
3. Manually delete originals in Photos app
4. Click "Delete Original Files" button in the app
5. Confirm deletion
6. **Expected:** Error alert shows "Asset not found with identifier: [ID]"

### Scenario 3: Permission Denied
1. Select photos from Photos library
2. Process them successfully
3. Revoke Photos permissions in Settings
4. Click "Delete Original Files" button
5. Confirm deletion
6. **Expected:** Error alert shows permission denied message

### Scenario 4: Mixed Success/Failure
1. Select multiple photos from Photos library
2. Process them successfully
3. Manually delete some originals in Photos app
4. Click "Delete Original Files" button
5. Confirm deletion
6. **Expected:** Error alert shows for the missing assets
7. **Expected:** No success alert (because some failed)

## Technical Details

### Error Codes
- **-1:** Unknown Photos deletion failure
- **-2:** Asset not found with identifier (NEW)
- **1:** Photos permission denied or limited
- **2:** Photos permission not granted

### Flow Diagram

```
User clicks "Delete Original Files"
         ↓
Confirmation dialog appears
         ↓
User confirms
         ↓
For each successful result:
    ├─ Fetch PHAsset using localIdentifier
    ├─ Verify asset.count > 0
    │   ├─ Yes → Perform deletion via PHAssetChangeRequest
    │   │         ├─ Success → deletedCount++
    │   │         └─ Error → Show error alert
    │   └─ No → Show "Asset not found" error
    ↓
All deletions complete
    ├─ All succeeded → Show success alert
    └─ Any failed → (error already shown)
```

## Benefits

1. **Fixes the Bug:** Assets are now properly validated before deletion
2. **Better UX:** Users get clear feedback on success
3. **Better Error Handling:** Specific error for missing assets
4. **Localized:** Full support in English and French
5. **Consistent:** Same behavior in Image and Video cleaners
6. **Safe:** Only shows success when ALL deletions succeed

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible
- All changes are additive (new validation, new alerts)
- Existing error handling paths remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to public APIs

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Show progress indicator during batch deletion
- [ ] Individual file status in results (deleted/failed)
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed deletions
- [ ] Option to skip confirmation for trusted users
- [ ] Undo deletion (if possible with PHAsset)
