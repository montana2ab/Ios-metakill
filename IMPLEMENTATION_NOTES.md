# PhotoKit Integration Implementation Notes

## Summary

This implementation adds complete photo and video selection capabilities to the MetadataKill iOS app, fulfilling the requirement to "implement PhotoKit integration for photo library access and everything needed for it to work on iPhone or simulator."

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PhotoKit Integration (Photo Library Access)
✅ **6 New Swift Files** implementing PHPickerViewController wrappers:
- `PhotoLibraryPicker.swift` - Select images from Photos app
- `VideoLibraryPicker.swift` - Select videos from Photos app  
- `MediaLibraryPicker.swift` - Select both images and videos

### 2. Document Picker Integration (Files App)
✅ **3 New Swift Files** implementing UIDocumentPickerViewController wrappers:
- `ImageDocumentPicker.swift` - Select image files from Files app
- `VideoDocumentPicker.swift` - Select video files from Files app
- `MediaDocumentPicker.swift` - Select any media files

### 3. View Updates
✅ Updated existing views to use new pickers:
- `ImageCleanerView.swift` - Now uses PhotoLibraryPicker and ImageDocumentPicker
- `VideoCleanerView.swift` - Now uses VideoLibraryPicker and VideoDocumentPicker (added photo option)
- `BatchProcessorView.swift` - Now uses MediaLibraryPicker and MediaDocumentPicker (fully implemented)

### 4. Localization
✅ Added missing localization strings (English + French):
- Video cleaner picker buttons
- Batch processor picker buttons

### 5. Privacy & Permissions
✅ Updated `Info.plist` with proper usage descriptions:
- NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
- NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription
- Localized versions already exist in InfoPlist.strings (EN/FR)

### 6. Documentation
✅ Created comprehensive documentation:
- `PHOTOKIT_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete implementation guide with testing instructions
- Updated `TODO.md` - Marked PhotoKit and file picker tasks as complete

## Key Features

### Modern iOS Best Practices
- ✅ Uses PHPickerViewController (not deprecated UIImagePickerController)
- ✅ Supports iOS 15+
- ✅ Async/await for all file operations
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Security-scoped resource management
- ✅ SwiftUI integration via UIViewControllerRepresentable

### User Experience
- ✅ Multiple file selection
- ✅ Live Photo detection
- ✅ Automatic iCloud download handling
- ✅ Both Photo Library and Files app support
- ✅ Proper file copying to temp directory
- ✅ Clean SwiftUI sheet presentation

### Privacy-First Design
- ✅ Clear usage descriptions
- ✅ Localized permission prompts
- ✅ No network calls
- ✅ Local processing only
- ✅ Minimal permissions requested

## Files Changed

## How It Works

### File Selection Flow

1. **User taps "Select from Photos"**
   → Sheet presents PHPickerViewController
   → User selects photos/videos
   → Picker returns PHPickerResult array

2. **Coordinator processes results**
   → Loads each file asynchronously
   → Copies to temp directory with unique UUID
   → Creates MediaItem with file metadata
   → Returns array of MediaItem objects

3. **View receives MediaItem array**
   → Updates @Published selectedItems
   → SwiftUI automatically refreshes UI
   → Items ready for metadata cleaning

### File Selection Flow (Files App)

1. **User taps "Select from Files"**
   → Sheet presents UIDocumentPickerViewController
   → User browses and selects files
   → Picker returns file URL array

2. **Coordinator processes URLs**
   → Starts accessing security-scoped resource
   → Copies file to temp directory
   → Stops accessing security-scoped resource
   → Creates MediaItem with file metadata
   → Returns array of MediaItem objects

3. **View receives MediaItem array**
   → Same as above

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test on Simulator

```bash
# Open Xcode project
open MetadataKill.xcodeproj

# Select iPhone 15 simulator (or any iOS 15+)
# Press Cmd+R to build and run

# In the app:
1. Tap "Clean Photos"
2. Tap "Select from Photos"
3. PHPicker should appear with simulator photos
4. Select one or more images
5. Verify they appear in the list

# Test Files app:
1. Tap "Select from Files"
2. Browse to a folder with images
3. Select files
4. Verify they appear in the list
```

### Test on Physical Device

1. Connect iPhone/iPad via USB
2. Configure code signing in Xcode
3. Select device in Xcode
4. Press Cmd+R to install and run
5. Grant photo library permission when prompted
6. Test all selection scenarios

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Layers

```
App Layer (SwiftUI Views)
    ↓ uses
Platform Layer (UIKit/PhotoKit wrappers)
    ↓ creates
Domain Layer (MediaItem models)
```

### Separation of Concerns
- **Platform**: All UIKit/PhotoKit implementation details
- **App**: SwiftUI views and user interaction
- **Domain**: Pure business models, no iOS dependencies

## Compliance & Best Practices

✅ **Apple Guidelines**
- Modern PHPickerViewController API
- Proper permission handling
- Security-scoped resources
- No deprecated APIs

✅ **Privacy**
- Clear usage descriptions
- Local-only processing
- No telemetry or tracking
- Minimal permissions

✅ **Code Quality**
- Type-safe Swift
- Error handling
- Memory management
- Async/await

✅ **User Experience**
- Multiple selection
- Both Photos and Files support
- Live Photo detection
- Automatic iCloud handling

## What Still Needs Testing

Since this was implemented in a Linux environment without Xcode:

1. ☐ **Build verification** - Confirm app builds without errors
2. ☐ **Runtime testing** - Test on simulator and device
3. ☐ **Permission flow** - Verify permission prompts appear correctly
4. ☐ **File selection** - Test selecting various image/video types
5. ☐ **iCloud photos** - Verify iCloud photos download and load
6. ☐ **Live Photos** - Test Live Photo detection
7. ☐ **Batch mode** - Test selecting mixed images and videos

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open MetadataKill.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Build the project** (Cmd+B)
   - Should compile without errors
   - Platform module should link correctly

3. **Run on simulator** (Cmd+R)
   - Test all picker flows
   - Verify UI responds correctly

4. **Test on device**
   - Install on physical iPhone/iPad
   - Test with real photos
   - Verify permissions work

5. **Process some media**
   - Select photos with metadata
   - Run cleaning operation
   - Verify metadata removal works

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails:
- Ensure iOS deployment target is 15.0+
- Check that Platform module is properly linked to App
- Verify all imports are correct

### If picker doesn't appear:
- Check Info.plist has permission keys
- Verify sheet(isPresented:) is properly bound
- Check console for permission errors

### If files don't load:
- Verify temp directory is accessible
- Check file copy operations
- Look for async/await errors

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered complete when:

- ☐ Code compiles without errors (pending Xcode verification)
- ☐ App runs on simulator (pending Xcode testing)
- ☐ Photo picker opens and shows photos (pending runtime testing)
- ☐ File picker opens and allows selection (pending runtime testing)
- ☐ Selected items appear in UI (pending runtime testing)
- ☐ Files can be processed for metadata removal (pending integration testing)

**Status**: ✅ Code Implementation Complete - ⏳ Pending Xcode Verification and Testing

**Note**: This implementation was completed in a Linux environment without access to Xcode. All Swift code has been written following iOS best practices and should compile successfully, but requires verification in Xcode before confirming it works on iPhone and simulator.
