# App Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the app icon file: **AppIcon-1024.png**

The icon has not been generated yet as it requires image design tools.

Please follow the instructions in `/APP_ICON_GUIDE.md` to create and add the app icon.

## Quick Steps:
1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG icon (blue shield with "X" design)
2. Name it `AppIcon-1024.png`
3. Place it in this directory
4. The `Contents.json` file is already configured to reference it

## Design Concept:
- Blue background (#1E88E5)
- White shield shape
- "X" symbol representing metadata removal
- Modern, flat design style
