# Solution Summary: Manual Delete Button for Original Files

## Issue
**French:** "comment lauto suppresion ne fontionne toujours pas on peut ajouter un bouton apres traitement pour propser de supprimer le fichier drigine"

**English Translation:** "Since auto-deletion still doesn't work, we can add a button after processing to propose to delete the original file"

## Solution Implemented

Added a manual "Delete Original Files" button that appears after successful processing, giving users control over when to delete original files.

## What Was Changed

### 1. User Interface (2 files)
- **ImageCleanerView.swift**: Added orange delete button with trash icon in results section
- **VideoCleanerView.swift**: Added same delete button with consistent behavior

### 2. Localization (4 files)
Added 5 new localization strings in both English and French:
- `results.delete_original_files` - Button label
- `results.delete_original_confirm_title` - Confirmation dialog title
- `results.delete_original_confirm_message` - Confirmation message
- `results.original_deleted` - Success message
- `results.deletion_failed` - Error message

Files updated:
- `Sources/App/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`
- `Sources/App/Resources/fr.lproj/Localizable.strings`
- `MetadataKill/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`
- `MetadataKill/fr.lproj/Localizable.strings`

### 3. Documentation (1 file)
- **DELETE_BUTTON_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Comprehensive implementation guide

## Key Features

✅ **Manual Control**: User decides when to delete, not automatic  
✅ **Safe**: Requires explicit confirmation with warning message  
✅ **Smart**: Only deletes successfully processed files  
✅ **Localized**: Full English and French support  
✅ **Error Handling**: Shows clear error messages if deletion fails  
✅ **Consistent**: Works for both images and videos  
✅ **Compatible**: Works with Photo Library and file system sources  

## How It Works

1. User processes photos/videos
2. After successful processing, an orange "Delete Original Files" button appears
3. User clicks the button
4. Confirmation dialog appears with warning
5. User confirms
6. Original files are deleted using existing deletion infrastructure
7. Success/error feedback is shown

## Technical Implementation

- Uses existing `LocalStorageRepository.deleteOriginal()` method
- Handles Photo Library deletions via `PhotoDeletionService`
- Handles file system deletions for imported files
- Runs on background tasks with MainActor UI updates
- Includes weak self references to prevent memory leaks
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## Total Changes
- **7 files modified**
- **380 lines added**
- **0 lines removed**
- **100% backward compatible**

## Benefits

1. **Solves the problem**: Provides reliable way to delete original files
2. **User-friendly**: Clear UI with confirmations
3. **Safe**: Can't accidentally delete files
4. **Flexible**: Works as a fallback when auto-delete doesn't work
5. **Localized**: Native language support
6. **Well-documented**: Complete implementation guide included

## Testing Status

✅ Code review passed  
⏳ Awaiting manual testing by user  

## Next Steps

User should test:

2. Process files from Files app → Delete → Verify deletion
3. Test in French language
4. Test error scenarios (permissions, read-only files)
