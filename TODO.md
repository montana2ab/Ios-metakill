## Notes

### Platform Limitations
- CoreGraphics, ImageIO, AVFoundation only available on Apple platforms
- PhotoKit requires iOS/iPadOS
- Background tasks have time limits
- Extensions have memory limits
- Some metadata fields may be hardware-specific

### Privacy Constraints
- Never log file paths or names
- Never log actual metadata content
- Never make network calls
- Never use third-party analytics
- Always process locally
- Always ask for minimum permissions

### Performance Targets
- 50 JPEG (12MP): < 30s on iPhone 12+
- Video re-mux: â‰ˆ I/O speed
- Video re-encode: ~1x real-time
- Share extension: < 10s for 5 items
- App launch: < 2s
- Settings change: Instant

## Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: Review high priority items
- **Monthly**: Review medium priority items
- **Quarterly**: Review low priority and future ideas
- **After Major Release**: Reassess priorities based on user feedback
